#+TITLE:   Paper Mode

Experimental PDF viewer for Emacs, using gtk directly on an Emacs window from a
dynamic module - the method invented by [[https://github.com/akirakyle/emacs-webkit][emcas-webkit]].

Currently I'm developing the viewer as a separate executable that opens a gtk
window. Once I have mouse controls and things stabilize I'll embed it into Emacs.
