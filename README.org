#+TITLE:   Paper Mode

Experimental PDF viewer for Emacs, rendering with mupdf and using gtk directly
on an Emacs window from a dynamic module - the method invented by [[https://github.com/akirakyle/emacs-webkit][emcas-webkit]].

Currently I'm developing the viewer as a separate executable that opens a gtk
window. Once I have mouse controls and things stabilize I'll embed it into Emacs.

* Todo list
- [-] Outside Emacs
  + [X] Ensure zoom & rotation work
  + [X] Scroll
  + [ ] Sensible page dimensions by default:
    Center with a fixed width if the window is too long, fit to width if
    sensible, calculate minimum width with ~fz_new_bbox_device~ if too small.
  + [X] Show more than one page at a time
  + [-] Mouse:
    - [ ] Smooth scrolling like Evince has
    - [X] Select text over multiple pages
    - [ ] Links:
      + [ ] Highlight on hover
      + [ ] Show destination in a mousce hover popup kinda thing
      + [ ] Follow on click
  + [ ] Lazy load page text
  + [ ] Pre render next pages and free previous pages
  + [ ] Synctex
- [ ] Inside Emacs
  + [ ] Evil controls. I can't do Emacs-style keybinds myself.
  + [ ] Search
    - [ ] Normal
    - [ ] With a swiper-like preview of the results
  + [ ] Imenu to show PDF outline/bookmarks
  + [ ] Change bg & fg colors to comply with the Emacs theme, pdf-midnight-mode
  + [ ] Opening PDFs with passwords
  + [ ] Ace link selection
  + [ ] pdftotext view
  + [ ] extract/open embedded files
  + [ ] Annotations with text editing through Emacs
  + [ ] Support for bookmark.el and org-store-link, saving page & scroll & zoom
  + [ ] Save current page and do accel paths
  + [ ] Better Epub control, setting CSS and such.
    Could use htmlize's face-to-css-spec.
  + [ ] Keybind to show PDF properties
