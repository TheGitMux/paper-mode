#+TITLE:   Paper Mode

Experimental PDF viewer for Emacs, rendering with mupdf and using gtk directly
on an Emacs window from a dynamic module - the method invented by [[https://github.com/akirakyle/emacs-webkit][emcas-webkit]].

* Usage
** Install:
*To build the shared object you'll need*: mupdf 1.17+ dev version, gtk3 dev version.
It should work with Emacs 27.
1. Clone the repo
2. Run ~make~
3. Add repo dir to load path
Alternatively, install through [[http://guix.gnu.org][Guix]] with ~guix package -f paper-mode.scm~
** Config
With [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/][use-package]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package paper
  ;; you could also add html, png, jpg
  :mode ("\\.pdf\\'"  . paper-mode)
  :mode ("\\.epub\\'"  . paper-mode)
  :mode ("\\.cbz\\'"  . paper-mode)
  :config
